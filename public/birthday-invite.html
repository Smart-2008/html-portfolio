<p>When you go inside the first door, on your right hand side will be a buzzer and press 139 then the call button, then someone will open the door. After that open the 2nd door and use the lift or stairs to get to the 3rd floor and come to the apartment which says 303 on it and then knock lightly until someone opens the door.</p>
