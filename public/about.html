<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Samarth, an 11 year old boy (12 years old) living in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I like to visit Niagara Falls because there are a lot of sights. Once I spent the night in a hotel. I really liked the food! My favorite color is dark blue, like the midnight sky. I love playing football with my friends, I play FIFA online! My favorite school subject is mathematics because I think it's really interesting and easy. I don't like science because it is boring and difficult. I also like French because I'm learning a new language. When I come home from school, my favorite thing to do is SHOWER!, because then I feel fresh. I was born on September 18, 2012. My favorite memory is when I went to the beach with my grandmother. I learned a lot from her, we talked A LOT! I also learn from my mother because she makes me study every day after school. My favorite toy was a toy car. I have a little sister who is 3 years old. Her name is Dhanni. I love it very much. When I grow up, I want to live in Africa and I want to become an electrical engineer. I would build a big mansion there. I love reading the Diary of a Wimpy Kid book series. I would love to interview the author of this book, andâ€¦ it would be a dream come true!</p>
